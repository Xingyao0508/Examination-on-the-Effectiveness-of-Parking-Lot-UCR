# Examination-on-the-Effectiveness-of-Parking-Lot-UCR
This project analyzes student satisfaction and behavior related to parking facilities at the University of California, Riverside. Using survey data and statistical methods in SPSS—including regression models, cross-tabulation, and chi-square tests—we identified key drivers of dissatisfaction, such as lack of convenience, safety concerns, and limited space.

The analysis revealed that:

Analysis (1). Poor parking availability negatively affects academic pursuits (coefficient = -0.463, p = 0.009).

Analysis (2). Negative perceptions of convenience and safety significantly reduce overall student experience (coefficient = -0.406, p = 0.023).

Analysis (3). Better availability of parking correlates with higher acceptance of parking permit pricing (coefficient = 0.334, p = 0.026).

Based on these insights, actionable recommendations—such as scooter rentals, increased shuttle frequency, and enhanced safety measures—were proposed to improve campus life and support academic success.
