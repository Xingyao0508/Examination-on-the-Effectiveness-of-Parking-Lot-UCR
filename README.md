# Examination-on-the-Effectiveness-of-Parking-Lot-UCR
This project analyzes student satisfaction and behavior related to parking facilities at the University of California, Riverside. Using survey data and statistical methods in SPSS—including regression models, cross-tabulation, and chi-square tests—we identified key drivers of dissatisfaction, such as lack of convenience, safety concerns, and limited space.

The analysis revealed that:

1. Poor parking availability negatively affects academic pursuits (coefficient = -0.463, p = 0.009).

2. Negative perceptions of convenience and safety significantly reduce overall student experience.

3. Better availability of parking correlates with higher acceptance of parking permit pricing.

Based on these insights, actionable recommendations—such as scooter rentals, increased shuttle frequency, and enhanced safety measures—were proposed to improve campus life and support academic success.
